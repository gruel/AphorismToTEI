A Python module called AphorismToTEI has been written by Jonathan
Boyle and Nicolas Gruel (University of Manchester) to convert transcribed
commentaries to `TEI <http://www.tei-c.org/index.xml>`_ compatible XML.

The version of Python is Python 3.5.1 (using Anaconda Python
2.4.1).

The commentaries were transcribed by `Kamran Karimullah
<mailto:karimullah.kamran@manchester.ac.uk>`_ and colleagues at the
University of Manchester.

Kamran also specified the requirements for the module.

The commentaries are written in Arabic, however the module can process text in
any language.

The work was funded from an ERC funded project studying Arabic
commentaries on the Hippocratic Aphorisms, the Principal Investigator
was Peter E. Pormann (The University of Manchester).
